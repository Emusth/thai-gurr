# thai-gurr
Website for fictional a restaurant.

Thai Gurr is a one-page, static website meant to fulfill the basic needs of a ficticious small-scale restaurant. 

The site is made from HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript and JQuery.

Notable features are its responsive design, JavaScript image gallery, embedded restaurant reviews, and Google Maps API.

Note: Due to being publically published, I have changed the API Key, so the API will not work.
